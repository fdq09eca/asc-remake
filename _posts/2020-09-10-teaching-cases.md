Thanks to the fundings from [Hong Kong Trade and Industry Department](https://www.tid.gov.hk), we have designed several teaching cases which are now available for download. These teaching cases aim to promote Economics, particularly in the area of International Trade, in an interactive style to secondary school students as well as general public. We would like like to appreciate the students from [Department of Economics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.econ.cuhk.edu.hk/econ/en-gb/) who devised the materials.

## 1. Invisible Trade

Teaching case "*Invisible Trade*" provides a glance at Hong Kong trade situation. News reports in recently years often claimed the decrease in cargo throughputs manifests that Hong Kong is losing its position as an international trading hub. If  we think thoroughly, we might ask whether it is true that cargo throughputs can tell us a full picture of trading situation, and that Hong Kong is becoming less competitive in trade. The guide and games in this teaching case sufficiently answer our questions by providing a new sight regarding trading methods.
